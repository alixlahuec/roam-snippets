This is where I write and store code snippets I use to extend the functionality of my Roam Research database. 

### What is Roam Research ?

Roam Research is an online software for organizing knowledge, thoughts and writing. You can find out more about Roam on [the official website](roamresearch.com), join the Slack community of users, or follow [@RoamResearch on Twitter](https://twitter.com/RoamResearch).

### List of extensions

 - [roam-copy-ref](roam-copy-ref/README.md)
 - [roam-get-linked-refs-data](roam-get-linked-refs-data/README.md)
 - [roam-get-paper-data](roam-get-paper-data/README.md)
 - [roam-import-paper-data](roam-import-paper-data/README.md) : uses the Zotero Web API to import data into Roam based on citekeys.

### How to (re-)use this code

There are a few options to make use of the code snippets I maintain here : 
 - Load an extension directly by using GitHub as CDN
 - Copy the contents of the JavaScript file for the extension, and paste them into a Roam code block nested under `{{[[roam/js]]}}` 
 
Specific installation instructions are provided on each extension's page.
