// ABOUT LATEX ------

// Table -- now that one's involved
// The content for each cell should probably be processed beforehand, then piped in
\begin{tabular}{ l l l } // Specify alignment here for each column
    Col 1     & Col 2     & Col 3  \\
    Text      & Some text & Other text \\
\end{tabular}

// Careful about special characters
// Gonna have to escape them

// How about citations ? (bibtex)
// According to roam2tex author, should be converted into \cite{} (see https://gist.github.com/sschuldenzucker/6ff5ce2e55d67da3f2c1afda365e0d6b)

// Major differences with roam2tex I think :
// - it seems based on a Markdown exported by Roam? Or some...text version ? So have to read line-by-line, e.g
// - it can't handle block references because Roam doesn't export them
// BUT since we're using the Roam alpha API, we can resolve block references/embeds if needed
// We also get the block-by-block content outline, and info about headings etc.
